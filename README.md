# UVA_Minor-Programming_Programming-1
Exercises for the Inleiding programmeren voor Natuur- en sterrenkunde course (2017)<br />
Warning this code is for python 2.x

for module 1 functions couldn't be used but a more efficient way of finding primes was found which was also added to the module.

Module 1
- module1 -       how to do prints
- list -          how to handle lists
- Primechecker -  checks a prime
- priemgetal -    find the nth prime (with and without functions)
- goldbach -      use the goldbach conjecture (with and without functions)
- plotting -      plot some coords
- reeks -         find the longest sequence non-primes (with and without functions)
- rekenwonder -   find the product of two numbers
- plot -          plots the function $x^x$ and find its minimum

Module 2
- nulpunten -       finds the roots of the function f(x)=ax^2+bx+c
- randomwiskunde -  find average number of randomly generated numbers that add up to 1
- afstand -         find the average distance of random points in a 1x1 square
- histogram -       make a histogram of a generated set of averages of subsets of 100 numbers
- riemann -         calculates the integral of $x^{x+0.5}$, $2\cdot tan(cos(sin(x)))$ & $3\cdot sin\left(x^2\right)$ using the Riemann summation method
- montecarlo -      calculates the integral of $x^{x+0.5}$, $2\cdot tan(cos(sin(x)))$, $3\cdot sin\left(x^2\right)$ & Twitter egg using the Monte-Carlo method

Module 3
- spiraal -              makes a plot of a spiral with the polar curve $R=10-0.5*\alpha$ 
- Monopoly_opdracht1 -   calculate how many throws it takes to occupy the whole board in a one player game of Monopoly with different amounts of starting money
- student -              plotting 2 drunken students and the distance between them
- Monopoly_realistisch - caluclate how much more money player 2 in a game of Monopoly has to have to have equal chances of occupying the board

Module 4
- autorit -     analyses the car trip data from a car journey AutoRitData.csv
- temperatuur - analyses the temperature data from DeBiltTempMax.txt and DeBiltTempMin.txt

Toets contains the exam for the course
